VNS
=

VNS is the easiest way to give students hands-on experience with networking
internals. With VNS, students write software that interacts with their own
topology of routers and servers using real-world services and protocols.

VNS is an open-source project available free of charge to students, instructors,
and researchers. It is supported by staff and students at Stanford
University. Assignments include a variety of tools, including student stub code,
grading scripts, and reference solutions. With assignments possible in any
language that supports standard sockets, VNS projects can be as small or as
large as your studentsâ€™ imaginations.

Please see the [VNS Homepage](http://yuba.stanford.edu/vns) for more information
about VNS.

This repository contains the VNS simulator, VNS web interface, and a
command-line client for altering and interacting with topologies while they are
running.
